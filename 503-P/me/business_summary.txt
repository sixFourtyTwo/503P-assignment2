Fly Me Up — Business Summary

Mission:
Fly Me Up transforms ordinary cars into enchanting flying machines. Using the proprietary “WingWhirl” enchantment,
vehicles gain the ability to soar through the skies while remaining fully drivable on land. The company’s mission is to
make the sky part of everyday travel through a blend of magic, engineering, and imagination.

Services Offered:
1. Lift & Drift — Converts your existing car into a functional flying car using the WingWhirl ritual.
   Cost: 44% of your car’s current market value, plus a small jar of moonlight.
2. Trade for the Skies — Fly Me Up purchases your car at 20% below market value, converts it, and sells it as part
   of its elite airborne fleet.
3. Personal Cloud Customization — Adds optional aesthetic or defensive enhancements such as glowing wings,
   crystal boosters, or meteor-proof shields for an additional 12% of the conversion cost.
All conversions take place at specialized sky docks, handled by certified aero-mages and levitation engineers.

Team:
Founded by Liora Venn, the sorceress-mechanic who discovered the WingWhirl spell, the team includes Flightsmiths,
Wind Whisperers, Crystal Engineers, and Ground Anchors. Together, they combine mechanical precision with magical
craftsmanship to ensure safety and elegance.

Unique Value Proposition:
Fly Me Up is the world’s first service that merges automotive technology with skybound enchantment. Customers can
experience both the practicality of driving and the freedom of flight. Every car becomes an expression of wonder—an
invitation to rise above traffic and embrace the sky.
